blurb: Inspired by Forrest Brazeal's [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/), I built this online resume as a static website and deployed it to a cloud service.
---
I built my digital resume with the Astro.js framework, React components and TypeScript.

The infrastructure is managed by Pulumi and deployed to Cloudflare Pages, offering completely free hosting, CDN, and DDoS protections.

Additional frameworks used include [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/).
