With a strong foundation in IT and Site Reliability Engineering, I specialize in cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps practices. My experience spans multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure and GCP where I've optimized infrastructure, implemented cost-effective solutions, and led security initiatives. I excel in automating complex processes using Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Pulumi, Terraform, and Ansible, enhancing efficiency and reducing human error.
